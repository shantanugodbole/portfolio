# Discover Who Shantanu is!

Finally after numerous attempts and being averse to web development, I have created my portofolio website! 

It's not the best of my works, but the inspiration comes from the Spotify UI, a service I use a lot.

There are a few issues when it comes to image rendering and mobile display, I will be patching those up soon!

The site is hosted on Netlify. You can find it [here](https://shangod.netlify.app/)!

Always open to feedback and suggestions!
